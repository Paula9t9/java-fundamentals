## Basics
The basics directory contains a simple Main.java file with the methods pluralize, flipNHeads, and clock.

### pluralize (String word, int number) 
takes a number and a string. Based on that number, it will determine if the string needs to be pluralized and returns the appropriate string. (TL;DR: it adds an 's' if the number is greater than 1 or equal to 0).

### flipNHeads(int numberOfHeadsDesired)
takes a number for how many times in a row you want to flip heads. It then "flips a coin" until that number is achieved and returns a summary of the results. 

### clock()
prints out the time every second. This is an intentionally infinite method. Run with caution.
